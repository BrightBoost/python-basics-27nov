# Exercises

1. Write an `if` statement to check if a patient's temperature exceeds 38. Print 'Fever detected!' if true.
2. Add an `else` clause to print 'Normal temperature' if the temperature is 38 or below.
3. Add an `elif` clause to handle 'Slight fever' for temperatures between 37 and 38.
4. Write a nested `if` statement to check both temperature and age. Print a warning for high-risk patients (e.g., age > 60 and high fever).
5. Create a script that checks multiple conditions (such as fever and BMI, but do freestyle!) and outputs a detailed risk assessment.
